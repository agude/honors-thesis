\begin{abstract}
We use principal component analysis of 23 supernova spectra within 3 days of maximum light in the B band in an effort to account for intrinsic diversity of type Ia supernova. We find that with only 5 eigenvectors we can account for 90\% of diversity within our sample. We further find that our first eigenvector correlates closely to color, although it has spectral absorbtion and emission features that are not expected if color is primarily due to extinction. We investiate the assumption that color is caused by extinction by attempting to match an average spectral template to our supernova and find it does an inadiquate job of matching the data.
