# Spectral Study of Twenty-Three Type Ia Supernovae Using Principal Component Analysis

## Abstract

We explore the diversity of type Ia supernovae near maximum light in the B
band. We use a principal component analysis on twenty-three well observed type
Ia supernovae in order to find a compact, numeric description for diversity.
We find that the first component---which mainly controls color---accounts for
76% of diversity in the sample, and that by using only five eigenvectors we
can account for 95.8% of diversity. We explore color diversity and find that
very few of the supernovae follow a Cardelli Law for E(B âˆ’ V ). We use the
weights calculated for each of the supernovae to devise a method to lower
dispersion of type Ia supernovae around the Hubble line using only a single
spectrum for each supernova, removing the need for multi-band light curves.
